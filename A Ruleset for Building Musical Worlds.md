## Sound World
A sound world is an auditory place which exists for a limited time. Sonic events happen in this world on a timeline, which the traveler usually explores in a linear direction in the instance of recorded worlds for listening, as opposed to recorded worlds for inhabiting.

## Direction of Time
By default, a sound world is explored by the traveler in a linear direction, entering the sound world each visit from the same point and leaving through the same exit, passing by all the areas of the world in an order that never changes.

## Variation Between Visits
Variation with each visit to a linear sound world is created by what the traveler brings with them, consciously or unconsciously. Travelers bring thoughts, emotions, experiences, memories, desires. It's worth noting travelers will bring these things to a nonlinear sound world also.

## Elements of a World
#### Sound
	A sound world must have at least one sound moving through time. This makes the landscape of the place.

#### Time
	The sound must exist for a unit of time.

#### On World Length
	Is a single note a world? It has an entrance and an exit and a sound, so in theory, yes. It appears to depend on length -- the length of a sound determines whether a traveler has time to enter, explore, and exit. A short single note does not seem to contain a world that can be visited. A minimum length, if a single sound, or a minimum of two sounds if length is very short. It may be that the ability to repeatedly visit a world is more important in the case of very small worlds.

#### Number of Sounds
	This is a matter of preference, but for the purposes of creating a ruleset, heed the following: 
*A world should be made of only as many sounds as do not obscure each other.*
A traveler should be able to easily discern each sound, as these are the features of the landscape to be explored, though the depth of each sound can be very great, so that the traveler discovers new angles and details with each visit.
