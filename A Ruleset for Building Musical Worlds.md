### Sound World
A sound world is an auditory space which exists for a limited time. Sonic events happen in this world on a timeline, which the traveler usually explores in a linear direction in the instance of recorded worlds for listening, as opposed to recorded worlds for inhabiting. Nonlinear sound worlds are explored either through random pathways, or through pathways chosen by the traveler.

### Traveler
A person who enters the sound world through listening. You are the traveler.

### Visit
A visit is a period of time during which the traveler enters, explores, and exits the sound world. In other words, a single listening of a sound world.

### Character
A sound or instrument that represents an entity within the sound world. A character can be sentient or 

## Direction of Time
By default, a sound world is explored by the traveler in a linear direction, entering the sound world each visit from the same point and leaving through the same exit, passing by all the areas of the world in an order that never changes.


# Characters
Characters (sounds or instruments) will be described with analogue synthesis.
# Agency of the Traveler
The traveler does not typically have much agency within a sound world itself, only making choices in the thoughts or pre-existing emotions they bring with them, and any external factors used to augment the visit (mood lighting, being alone or in company, walking or sitting, etc.)

# Dark vs Light Listening
Dark listening is when the traveler enters the world with closed eyes and maintains this state until exiting the world. Light listening is when the traveler enters with eyes open and leaves them open until exiting, fixing their sight either on one particular view, or observing a variety of visuals while simultaneously traversing the sound world.

# Variation Between Visits
Variation with each visit to a linear sound world is created by what the traveler brings with them, consciously or unconsciously. Travelers bring thoughts, emotions, experiences, memories, desires. It's worth noting travelers will bring these things to a nonlinear sound world also, but a nonlinear sound world has its own explicit variations.

# Elements of a World
#### Sound
	A sound world must have at least one sound moving through time. This makes the landscape of the place.

#### Time
	The sound must exist for a unit of time. This makes the landscape traversable.

#### On Small Worlds
>*Is a single note a world? It has an entrance and an exit and a sound, so in theory, yes. Whether it is traversable depends on length -- the length of a sound determines whether a traveler has time to enter, explore, and exit. A short single note does not seem to contain a world that is traversable; for a single sound, a minimum length is required, or a minimum of two sounds if length is very short. It may be that the ability to repeatedly visit a world is more important in the case of very small worlds such as these.*

#### Number of Sounds or World Density
	This is a matter of preference, but for the purposes of creating a ruleset, heed the following: 
*A world should be made of only as many sounds as do not obscure each other.*

A traveler should be able to easily discern each sound, as these are the features of the landscape to be explored, though the depth of each sound can be very great, so that the traveler discovers new angles and details with each visit.

#### History
All places have a sense of past. So should a sound world, to seem real. Sometimes this is achieved by the nature of the sound: if it is a sound familiar in some way to the traveler, there will be a sense of past projected onto the world by the traveler. For the purposes of this ruleset, we will take a more direct approach to history:
*What is the story of each sound? Each must be like a character -- who? What does the character represent? What is its personal history? A low, sweeping synth pad may be Regret, underpinning every other feature of the world, or it may be a tragic steward of the world who longs for his lost love who was taken by sickness. The sound can represent the character and their story or state. The character can be a concept (like 'the decay of a technological society'), a person (like 'the wise keeper of the grove'), an object (like 'the derelict hulk on the ocean floor'). The important thing is what has happened to the character. This informs how the sound will move through time, its motivation for movement, what it wants.*

> Write out the **character** and **history** of each sound.

#### Events
Events are usually transitions within the sound world. The traveler moves from one area of the world to another, or something happens to the landscape of the world itself, or a new character appears.

#### Complexity
A world that is traversable, deep, unobscured, allows for a complex experience for the traveler.

#### Nonlinear Worlds
A sound world in which each time it is visited, the traveler enters and exits from unknown points, and traverses its areas in an unknown order. A world of this type has a series of sounds which overlap and bleed into each other, so that no matter where the traveler goes, the world remains a coherent whole. 

Predetermined variations can be included which are not experienced each visit, as well as random elements to sounds which are never repeated, or even sounds which do not appear each visit (verse . There is an element of probability here which will be controlled with predetermined rules. There is beauty in knowing that what a traveler experiences in a nonlinear world may never be experienced by anyone else: a certain harmony, an unexpected melody, a coincidental rhythm. There may be sections of the world which are designed to produce more climactic events, and others where events are sparse. In this way a 'map of the world' can be created to prepare for randomness to occur, with clearly marked areas of controlled randomness, an organic system.

## On Randomness
For a world to seem real, there must be a certain amount of unpredictability, the feeling that things are happening irrespective of the traveler, and maybe even events that surprise the characters of the world.

This ruleset prescribes randomness within a set of carefully crafted parameters that serve each world and its characters and events. Certain characters or events can link worlds, as can certain repeating rules. Elements that can be recognized between two different worlds will link them, even if the connection goes unobserved by the traveler.

## Mystery
For the purposes of this ruleset, each sound world should begin by creating a sense of curiosity within the traveler. This can be achieved through History, and especially through placing only a single character within the entrance to the world. The character should be starting to say something, the meaning of which is yet unknown.

To seek an answer to a mystery is one of the greatest pleasures and powers. Create this seeking in the sound world.

- say words that are indiscernible
- ambiguity in instruments (one instrument sounding like another)
- indistinct harmonies

## Locus
- imagining doing things in an imaginary space as a way to remember things. Place the things somewhere in an imaginary space.

## Duality and Contradiction
One rule for this project will be to try to include elements that exist in contradiction to each other (soft/loud, light/dark, etc.), with the idea that 'mastery is being able to hold two contradictory forces or elements in balance.' Chiaro/scuro. This is part of the in-between.

## Evolving Sounds
Each sound should change, grow, diminish, evolve as the traveler moves past it in Time, as if seeing it from new angles, and as the sound approaches and retreats from Events. In this way sounds are alive. (changing vowels with the voice, randomness within synths, envelopes, overtones added or removed)

### Fading In/Out
Each sound could fade in and fade out, creating a sense of moving through a world.

## Rests
Any traveler will pause to rest at times while exploring. A sound world should allow for the same with ambient sections.

## Combining Two Random Ideas
Trying to make sense of how two unrelated ideas fit together can birth a unique new idea. Combine pairs of unrelated ideas.


## Nonlinearity and Power
One way to do nonlinear worldbuilding could be to consider power struggles between the sounds or 'characters' of the world. Each visit, different characters may win power, therefore they are the ones who feature more prominently in the world.


## Evolving Rhythms

# Emerging Rhythms
Some worlds will have a chance to develop rhythms. When a rhythmic element/event/character begins, it triggers a probability to continue to develop that sequence into a full rhythmic segment.

## Live Performance
Certain events will only trigger randomly. If they trigger during live performance, the performer can react to that trigger and begin the accompanying part. This makes each performance unique.

## Lyric Variation
A bank of lyrics can be queried to randomly select passages or words each time a vocal character or event appears.

## Deterioration
Slowly deteriorating over time (harmonic stability / bit crusher intensity). Nothing built lasts.


# Ideas for Individual Worlds
1. A nonlinear world which the traveler enters from a different point each visit and explores in a varying order.
2. A nonlinear world which begins from the same entry point each visit but the sounds vie for dominance so that different sounds and events feature more prominently by the end of each visit.
3. A nonlinear world in which the lyrical content is randomized to an extent.
4. A nonlinear world composed of overlapping choral sounds which move through different harmonic areas each visit.
5. A nonlinear world of organic sound samples which are manipulated differently each visit. (possible?)
