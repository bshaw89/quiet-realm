## Sound World
A sound world is an auditory space which exists for a limited time. Sonic events happen in this world on a timeline, which the traveler usually explores in a linear direction in the instance of recorded worlds for listening, as opposed to recorded worlds for inhabiting. Nonlinear sound worlds are explored either through random pathways, or through pathways chosen by the traveler.

## Direction of Time
By default, a sound world is explored by the traveler in a linear direction, entering the sound world each visit from the same point and leaving through the same exit, passing by all the areas of the world in an order that never changes.

## Agency of the Traveler
The traveler does not typically have much agency within a sound world itself, only making choices in the thoughts or pre-existing emotions they bring with them, and any external factors used to augment the visit (mood lighting, being alone or in company, walking or sitting, etc.)

## List

## Variation Between Visits
Variation with each visit to a linear sound world is created by what the traveler brings with them, consciously or unconsciously. Travelers bring thoughts, emotions, experiences, memories, desires. It's worth noting travelers will bring these things to a nonlinear sound world also.

## Elements of a World
#### Sound
	A sound world must have at least one sound moving through time. This makes the landscape of the place.

#### Time
	The sound must exist for a unit of time. This makes the landscape traversable.

#### On Small Worlds
>*Is a single note a world? It has an entrance and an exit and a sound, so in theory, yes. Whether it is traversable depends on length -- the length of a sound determines whether a traveler has time to enter, explore, and exit. A short single note does not seem to contain a world that is traversable; a minimum length, if a single sound, is required, or a minimum of two sounds if length is very short. It may be that the ability to repeatedly visit a world is more important in the case of very small worlds such as these.*

#### Number of Sounds
	This is a matter of preference, but for the purposes of creating a ruleset, heed the following: 
*A world should be made of only as many sounds as do not obscure each other.*

A traveler should be able to easily discern each sound, as these are the features of the landscape to be explored, though the depth of each sound can be very great, so that the traveler discovers new angles and details with each visit.

#### History
All places have a sense of past. So should a sound world, to seem real. Sometimes this is achieved by the nature of the sound: if it is a sound familiar in some way to the traveler, there will be a sense of past projected onto the world by the traveler. For the purposes of this ruleset, we will take a more direct approach to history:
*What is the story of each sound? Each must be like a character -- who? What does the character represent? What is its personal history? A low, sweeping synth pad may be Regret, underpinning every other feature of the world, or it may be a tragic steward of the world who longs for his lost love who was taken by sickness. The sound can represent the character and their story or state. The character can be a concept (like 'the decay of a technological society'), a person (like 'the wise keeper of the grove'), an object (like 'the derelict hulk on the ocean floor'). The important thing is what has happened to the character. This informs how the sound will move through time, its motivation for movement, what it wants.*

> Write out the **character** and **history** of each sound.

#### Events
Events are usually transitions within the sound world. The traveler moves from one area of the world to another, or something happens to the landscape of the world itself, or a new character appears.

#### Complexity
A world that is traversable, deep, unobscured, allows for a complex experience for the traveler.

#### Nonlinear Worlds
A sound world in which each time it is visited, the traveler enters and exits from unknown points, and traverses its areas in an unknown order. A world of this type has a series of sounds which overlap and bleed into each other, so that no matter where the traveler goes, the world remains a coherent whole. Predetermined variations can be included which are not experience each visit, as well as random elements to sounds which are never repeated, or even sounds which do not appear each visit. There is an element of probability here which will be controlled with predetermined rules. There is beauty in knowing that what a traveler experiences in a nonlinear world may never be experienced by anyone else: a certain harmony, an unexpected melody, a coincidental rhythm. There may be sections of the world which are designed to produce more climactic events, and others where events are sparse. In this way a 'map of the world' can be created to prepare for randomness to occur, with clearly marked areas of controlled randomness, an organic system.

## On Randomness
For a world to seem real, there must be a certain amount of unpredictability, the feeling that things are happening irrespective of the traveler, and maybe even events that surprise the characters of the world.

This ruleset prescribes randomness within a set of carefully crafted parameters that serve each world and its characters and events. Certain characters or events can link worlds, as can certain repeating rules. Elements that can be recognized between two different worlds will link them, even if the connection goes unobserved by the traveler.
