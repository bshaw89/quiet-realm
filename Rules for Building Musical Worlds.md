## Sound World
A sound world is an auditory place which exists for a limited time. Sonic events happen in this world on a timeline, which the traveler usually explores in a linear direction in the instance of recorded worlds for listening, as opposed to recorded worlds for inhabiting.

## Direction of Time
By default, a sound world is explored by the traveler in a linear direction, entering the sound world each visit from the same point and leaving through the same exit, passing by all the areas of the world in an order that never changes.

## Variation Between Visits
Variation with each visit to a linear sound world is created by what the traveler brings with them, consciously or unconsciously. Travelers bring thoughts, emotions, experiences, memories, desires. It's worth noting travelers will bring these things to a nonlinear sound world also.
